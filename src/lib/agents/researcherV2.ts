- **Inconsistent Department Practices**: When each department does onboarding differently, it can lead to confusion. Use a standardized checklist to unify the experience.  
- **No Defined Milestones**: If new hires don’t know what’s expected in their first weeks or months, they can feel lost. Setting 7-30-90 day targets helps track progress.  
- **Underutilizing Technology**: Relying on paper forms and manual emails hinders efficiency. Adopt onboarding software to automate repetitive tasks.  
- **Lack of Personalization**: One-size-fits-all onboarding can miss the specific needs of different roles. Provide role-specific resources and training for higher engagement.  
- **Neglecting Long-Term Support**: Focusing only on the first day or week can make employees feel abandoned later. Extend onboarding over weeks or months with ongoing feedback.

> **Quote**: “Small but strategic tweaks to your onboarding process can prevent confusion, reduce attrition, and foster a smoother integration.”
