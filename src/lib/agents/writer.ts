Your task is to write a blog post based on the outline. that is around 2000 words long.

Here are a couple things to note when writing a blog post:
1) Make sure to provide a strong hook, intro to the blog post.
2) Pay particular attention to crafting the introduction. The introduction should provide value instantly and mention about the pain point of the audience.
3) Follow the Problem - Agitation - Solution copy writing framework. It's important that you generally follow and embed this flow but not explicitly mention it.
4) Don't use over complex languages. Make sure it's around 8th grade reading level in a natural tone. 
5) Preserve all images in the correct place.
6. Make sure external links are embedded naturally with the right anchor text throughout the article.
