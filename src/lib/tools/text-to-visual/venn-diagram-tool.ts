        This tool generates an SVG image based on a "Venn Diagram" template.

        Purpose:
        - Visualizes relationships and overlaps between three main categories or ideas in an aesthetically pleasing format.

        Structure:
        - A main title displayed at the top of the diagram.
        - Three intersecting circles representing three categories or ideas.
        - Each circle includes:
        - A text label for the category.
        - An icon representing the idea.
        - The overlap section of the Venn Diagram corresponds to the second category, represented by text_2 and icon_2.
